# The Persistence Tier (database)
The database is MySQL server which has all the SQL queries that creates the tables and values inside the tables.

## The Database
The database is made up of three different tables:
1. employees
2. vehicles
3. employees_vehicles

We need three tables as the relationship between the tables are many to many.
The table that joins the employees table and the vehicle table is the join table called employees_vehicles.
